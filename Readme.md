For this project, the task was to refactor the code for the website of an internet marketing company, Horiseon. 

The requirements included:

1. Use of semantic html elements
2. Logical code structure
3. Alt attributes on images and icons for accessibility
4. Heading attributes appear in order
5. A descriptive and concise title element


What I did:
* Added a descriptive and concise title
* Added semantic HTML to optimize the code for clarity
* The CSS was consolidated by reusing classes when possible and deleting redundant styles. The HTML was updated to reflect these changes.
* alt attritubtes added to images
* Heading elements changed to be sequential

I added screenshots of the site which can be viewed here:
