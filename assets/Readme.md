For this project, the task was to refactor the code for the website of an internet marketing company, Horiseon. 

The requirements included:

1. Use of semantic html elements
2. Logical code structure
3. Alt attributes on images and icons for accessibility
4. Heading attributes appear in order
5. A descriptive and concise title element is included


What I did:
* A better title was given to the site
* I added semantic HTML to optimize the code for clarity
* The CSS was consolidated by reusing classes when possible, these changes are reflected in the HTML as well, redundant styles were deleted. 
* I added alt attritubtes to the images
* I changed the heading elements to be sequential

I added a screenshots of the site which can be viewed here:
